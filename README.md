# List-Based File Copy Script

A script to copy files from one folder to another based on a list of strings.

<p align='justify'>
This script is useful in an enterprise environment for recovering large volumes of files. It reads a list of search strings from a text file, for example, if you have third thousand files in a folder and you want to select just one hundred. It looks for files containing these strings in their names and copies the corresponding files to a designated folder destination.

It Saves significant time and effort when handling large data sets.
